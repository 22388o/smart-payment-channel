\section{The whitepaper}
After studying the whitepaper\cite{decker2015fast} that describes a bidirectional payment channel that we'll try to implement, I decided to go simple and start by implementing a single node bidirectional payment channel implementation. The whitepaper goes further and implements a multi-node bidirectional payment channels, but depending on how the project develops, we may not be able to implement it before the project deadline arrives.

At the moment of writing this document, I've reviewed the paper and started implementing the funding script, but without having tested the script on the network yet.

As appeared on the initial report, the final goal is to implement a bidirectional payment channel based on the idea and protocol explained on the Christian Decker's paper \cite{decker2015fast}. The software that implements the payment channel must be able to create a payment channel asking the user for parameters that can be understandable for a person with basic Bitcoin knowledge about its operation.\\\\
Depending on the timing, that has changed due to optimistic estimations, we'll achieve a certain level of automation and ease to create the channel. We don't know how many iterations of software development (transaction model, script model, implementation and test) will take until the payment channel gets implemented and its operational. After that, the rest of cycles or iterations will be dedicated to automate and enforce the channel security. 

\section{Conclusion}
Despite the new and advanced low-level knowledge of Bitcoin that has made us reschedule the timing due to optimistic timings, we still think that can achieve the main goal of creating an operational bidirectional payment channel using the Christian Decker's protocol. What will change is that the automation and ease of use of the channel maybe won't be the same as the expected in the initial report.

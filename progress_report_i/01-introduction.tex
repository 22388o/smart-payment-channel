In this first progress report, we will review the \textit{Bitcoin Payment Channels} project development since the last report, the project initial report, listing the accomplished project goals and tasks, the changes made to the project planning and the problems and solutions implemented during this time to acquire and fulfill with success the project's tasks.

\section{Brief summary of the current status}
In the first place, the project planning changed due to mainly bad timing estimations (very optimistic timings in most cases), rearranging tasks to reduce complexity and improve readability and a few changes to improve visualization. Those changes were performed after the general and low-level Bitcoin cryptocurrency study, assigning more time to the payment channel transactions modelling and testing because of the lack of good documentation about the topic found after hours of searching over the network for good information sources and the time lapse between blocks (approximately 10 minutes\cite{tbtc_blockr_io_charts:online}) so we can check if our transactions get accepted by the network consensus. Despite that, the project's development schedule has been respected and the project's goals until this report's drafting have been completed with success. 

In the following pages, we will give detailed information about all the progress done withing this time lapse between the first report delivery and this report drafting, the changes we had to apply to our project schedule and predictions to the project progress based on our acquired experience.
